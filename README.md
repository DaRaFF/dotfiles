# dotfiles

My dotfiles :-)

## Inspiration

- [Dotfiles Marc Bachmann](https://github.com/marcbachmann/dotfiles)
- [Brew Bundle and Brewfile Tips](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f)
- [zsh + antigen + oh-my-zsh guide](https://phuctm97.com/blog/zsh-antigen-ohmyzsh)

## Manual

Actions I did manually (to be maybe automated in the future)
- system settings/keyboard/keyboard
  - key repeat -> fast
  - delay until repeat -> short
  - use f1, f2 keys as standard function keys
- add ssh key to ~/.ssh
- chrome extensions
- chrome settings
  - password - disable "Offer to save passwords"
- better touch tool (screen resizing shortcuts)
  - maybe replace it later with hammerspoon actions
